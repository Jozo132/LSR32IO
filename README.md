# LSR32IO
LSR 32IO Expansion library. 
SPI I/O expansion for microcontrollers and microprocessors. 
Supports input range between +5V to +50V DC and output capability of +9V to 36V DC with each output capable of 100mA curent.


# Design
The module is made of using almost only off-the-shelf low-cost parts.
It is designed to work in industrial environments where reliable I/O control is desired.

The module uses the SPI interface to communicate with a host controller.
